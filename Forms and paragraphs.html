            Duolingo is an American language-learning website and mobile app. 
        Users learn using "trees" tailored to their target language, 
        with specific "skills" to practice vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation using spaced repetition. 
        Exercises within skills can include written translation, reading comprehension, speaking comprehension, 
        and short story exercises. As of June 2021, Duolingo offers 103 different language courses in 40 languages. 
        Duolingo has over 500 million registered users. The company uses a freemium model: 
        the app and the website are accessible without charge, although Duolingo also offers a premium service for a fee.
